# PIN

[About a PIN](../../overview/glossary.md#pin).

Itâ€™s important to create a strong PIN. If a person can guess the PIN, they will have access to all your accounts.

If you have forgotten your PIN, set a new one.

## Characters

Use a string of random characters:

- Latin alphabet.
- Digits.
- Special characters.

To create a PIN:

1. Generate the password in any application.
1. Randomly change and shuffle characters.

## Length

Use the length of 8 characters. This length is strong enough.

## Change frequency

Change your PIN from time to time. You can never say where a surveillance camera could record you entering it.

## Signing in

In a public place, use the PIN instead of the origin password.

Use the origin password as frequently as the PIN to reduce the risk of forgetting your origin password.
