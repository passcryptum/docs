# Service

[About a service](../../overview/glossary.md#service).

## Name

Create services by the name of their second-level domain.

For example: GitHub in the Passcryptum will have the name of “github.com”.

This rule will allow you to remember the service names in case you have to restore them from scratch.

## Settings

Use default settings whenever it is possible:

- The usage of special characters.
- The length of 20 characters.

Some of the services have list of characters you can use and which you can’t. So if the service doesn’t accept special characters, disable the parameter.

Keep im mind, if the services file is lost, you will have to remember what password length has set for each service.
