# Origin password

[About an origin password](../../overview/glossary.md#origin-password).

It’s important to create a strong origin password. If a person can guess the password, they will have access to all your accounts.

## Characters

Use a string of random characters:

- Latin alphabet.
- Digits.
- Special characters.

To create a password:

1. Generate the password in any application.
1. Randomly change and shuffle characters.

## Length

Use the length from 8 characters. This length is strong enough.

## Strength

If you comply with the [Characters](#characters) and [Length](#length) sections, the number of possible passwords is 90⁸ = 4 304 672 100 000 000, where:

- 90 is the number of characters to use.
- 8 is the length.

The strongest password length is 12 characters. Even hackers with powerful equipment won’t gain access to your accounts.

90¹² = 282 429 536 481 000 000 000 000

## Not recommended length

The password with the length of 12 characters is dangerous. You may forget it.

It’s forbidden to forget your origin password because it’s impossible to restore. It’s your full responsibility to remember your origin password.

## Signing in

In a public place, if you have forgotten your PIN, be careful while entering your origin password.
