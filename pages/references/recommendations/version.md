# Version

[About a version](../../overview/glossary.md#version).

Increase the password version by 1 every time you want to change it.

As a rule, passwords don’t change often, so you won’t have to sort through too many versions.

Keep im mind, if the services file is lost, you will have to remember the version of each password.
